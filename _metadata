  "description" : "Version 1.1.2 Released, adding scythes, new wand charge sounds, and the ability to play as a nocturnal Saturnian.\n\nSaturnians are moth wizards. For many generations, they have passed down techniques for making \"light weaving\" wands. Saturnians yearn to explore the unknown and meet new species. Saturnian villages are usually built on floating islands anchored to the ground.\n\n--------\n\nTHIS MOD REQUIRERS A CHARACTER CREATION EXTENDER. \n\nAny character creation extender that works with the latest version of Starbound, like [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729426722] Xbawks Character Extender [/url], should work.\n\n--------\n\nThis mod comes with:\n\n    Saturnian species, of course.\n\t\n    An alternate, nocturnal, Saturnian species. This is a WORK IN PROGRESS! In the future this variant will have more of a witch theme.\n\t\n    A sky village with many different shops\n\t\n    Almost no lore, still.\n\n    New racial armor and weapons, including wands, scythes, rapiers, bows, maces, and some others.\n\t\n    Nectar that Saturnians can craft from flower petals\n\n    Silk that Saturnians can craft from nectar\n\t\n    Lots of new clothes\n\n    New racial mech parts\n\n    A ship that's basically just a recolored glitch ship\n\n    16+ craftable wings that remove fall damage and lowers gravity slightly\n\t\n    Extra dye colors just for Saturnian equipment\n\n    A Saturnian loom for crafting wings, dyes, and clothes\n\n    Simple ship AI with slightly different dialog at the start\n\t\n    A new plant to grow\n\n    Tenant support, merchants can sell some bonus armor and weapons you can't normally craft\n\n    New furniture\n\t\n    New tiles\n\n    Custom respawn animation\n\n    Tons and tons of customization options\n\n    Some wanderers that aren't Saturnians?\n\n    Realistic moth noises!\n\n    More stuff that I probably forgot about\n\n\n================================\nF.A.Q.- Read before commenting please!â€‹\n================================\n\nQ: Where are their wings?\nA: The wings are back items. Your shiplocker has a basic set, but you can craft more kinds of wings for very cheap with a Saturnian loom.\n\nQ: Where do I get the new items from?\nA: Most weapons, armor and furniture are crafted where you would craft the vanilla versions of them (Anvil, Workbench). Clothes, wings, new dyes, and other extra things are crafted with the Saturnian Loom you get from your shiplocker. Villagers sell plenty of new items as well.\n\nA list of all tile and object IDs can be found here: https://pastebin.com/gfxbh7A7\n\nQ: Why do they squeak when injured?\nA: It's based on the death's-head hawkmoths squeaking when they are irritated.\n\nQ: How do I get Saturnian tenants?\nA: Place Saturnian furniture before placing a colony deed. Saturnian furniture is crafted at a workbench like other furniture is.\n\nQ: Does this work in multiplayer?\nA: I don't know. Sorry!\n\nQ: Is there Frackin Races support?\nA: Yes. The nocturnal Saturnians give different stat boosts from diurnal Saturnians. Weapon bonuses also work with Saturnian versions of scythes, rapiers, and maces just like they would for Frackin Universe's own.\n\nQ: Will you add villages?\nA: There's a village now! I'll probably add more later.\n\nQ: Where are the villages?\nA: Villages most often appear on snow worlds. There's a random chance they will appear above Forest, Desert, Jungle, Snow, Tundra, Alien, or Savannah Planets. They are always attached to the ground with a giant chain surrounded by a two guard towers. They can be rare though, especially if you have other village/dungeon adding mods.\n\n===================\nMODDING QUESTIONS\n===================\n\nQ: What IDs do this mod use?\nA: As of 1.1 It now uses the material IDs 54700-54720 and the liquid ID 36 . All ID names are prefixed with \"Sat\" or \"Saturn\", if your mod uses the same prefix for names, there is a risk of conflicts.\n\nQ: What is the dungeon ID for the village?\nA: \"saturnskygarden\" (Without the quotes)\n\nQ: I've been working on a mod that is similar to yours. Do I need your permission to upload it?\nA: No. You may even use my mod's assets if it will help! Just follow the permissions below.\n\nQ: Can I make an addon for this mod?\nA: As of July 18, 2018, Anyone can use assets from this mod or make addons, as long as you maintain compatibility with the base mod. Some notification that you are doing this would still be nice.\n\nIf you use someone's assets, do not break the mod you are taking from. Change any IDs you are using. The easiest way to do this is by adding your username to the beginning of the ID.\n\n===============================\nMods that support or require Saturnians\n===============================\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=894542254] B.Y.O.S.
