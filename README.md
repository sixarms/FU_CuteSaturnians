# FU_CuteSaturnians

This is a merge of Cyan Sky Knight's mod 'The Saturnians" and Window Novakid's mod 'Make the Saturnians a Cuter Yet Mothy Race' with the following tweak to make it compatible with the Official Frackin Universe server.

Mod Source - 'Make the Saturnians a Cuter Yet Mothy Race'
  1.  Removed all files in the root mod folder.
  2.  Removed the recipes folder.
  3.  Removed the items/armors/Hats.. folder.
  4.  Merged remaining items/armors.. folders into respective folders in 'The Saturnians' mod.  No new folders added.
  5.  Merged the species/.. folder into the respective folder in 'The Saturnians' mod.  1 file added:  saturrn.species.patch
  6.  Edited saturn.species.patch to remove lines that added a new Item not included in 'The Saturnians' mod.
  7.  Verified that remaining changes in saturn.species.patch file only contained changes to character creation parameters.
